## Visual Design Principles Applied

### ✅ Good Visual Aids Examples Implemented

1. **Comprehensive Architecture Diagrams**
   - Clear component relationships
   - Logical grouping of elements
   - Consistent color coding
   - Proper flow direction

2. **Process Flow Diagrams with Branches**
   - Decision points clearly marked
   - Multiple paths for different scenarios
   - Error handling flows
   - Success and failure states

3. **Box Diagrams for Frameworks**
   - Hierarchical structure
   - Clear boundaries between layers
   - Technology stack organization
   - Component dependencies

4. **Detailed Sequence Diagrams**
   - Step-by-step process flows
   - Actor interactions
   - Time-based sequences
   - Clear data flow

5. **Security Architecture Visualization**
   - Multi-layer security approach
   - Threat mitigation strategies
   - Access control matrices
   - Compliance frameworks

### ❌ Avoided Bad Visual Aids

1. **No Simple Linear Flows**
   - All flow diagrams include decision points and branches
